                # Explanation
                # Each CHAR / INT has its own Unicode
                # e.g. 
                # Unicode | INT
                # 0       | 48
                # 1       | 49
                # 9       | 57
                # a       | 97
                # b       | 98
                # z       | 122

                #   print(f'Char: ', char)
                #   print(f'Unicode: ', ord(char))
                #
                # Outputs
                # Unicode  | CHAR
                # 73       | I
                # 110      | n
